# RepoOrgUI
RepoOrgUI is a code repo organizer. I usually checkout all my code in one or two large folders on my computer. I have multiple tasks in multiple repos during the day, always felt that starting from a single launchpad would assist my dev process. This program can :-
1. **List all git repos** in a single folder.
2. Show some simple **information for each repo** in a list like view.
3. Allow **launching several tools** and tasks for each of the code repos via a toolbar.

**Note:** *This tool is built on the belief that tool should follow workflow rather the other way around. Therefore I've built it around my way of working with git repos. If you wish you can take the program and tweak it accordingly.*

## Built using PySimpleGUI
It's built using [pysimplegui](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is excellent for rapid gui development. I would not have made something like this in a few days, without this API.
